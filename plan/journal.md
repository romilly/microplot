# Project journal for microplot

## Tuesday 02 March 2021

Lots of interest, and useful work over thew last couple of days on Plotters for the Adafruit Clue and PyPortal.

I need to write an end-to-end test using a saved bitmap before working on the refactoring needed to extend the range 
of plot types and supported boards.

I'm going to adapt the adafruit 24-colour bitmap saver.
