# microplot

## A simple MicroPython plotting package.

The current version runs on the Raspberry Pi Pico with the Pimoroni Pico Explorer base, the Adafruit Clue and 
Adafruit PyPortal.

It does Line plots amd Scatter plots at the moment.

Some code was copied from https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-Pico-Explorer-Workout/
- Tony Goodhew's great introduction to the Pico Explorer.

The line drawing uses code from https://github.com/encukou/bresenham

## Installation

On all platforms, copy the Python files in `src/microplot/shared` to the device.

Then copy plotter.py from `src/micorplot/explorer` if you're using the Pomoroni explorer,
or from `src/microplot/adafruit` if you're using one f the Adafruit devices.

## Quick Start

There are three demos you can run:
1. `demo.py` shows a single-line plot of a sine wave,
1. `demo_multi.py` shows a plot of multiple sine waves,
1. `scatter_demo.py` shows a scatter plot of some arbitrary data.

## Bitmap saving

There's [code to save bitmaps](src/microplot/explorer/bitmapsaver.py) from the Pico Explorer Base.

To save bitmaps on the PyPortal you'll need to use a patched version of Adafruit's bitmap saver available
[here](src/microplot/adafruit/adafruit_bitmapsaver.py) and then run code like [this demo](src/microplot/adafruit/code.py)

## Samples

There are more [sample displays](SAMPLES.md) along with the code used to create them

## Road Map

1. Improve the documentation
1. Add box plots
1. Add examples for other displays
1. Add a *Contributing* guide
